Ongoing tasks:
1. Test the glm_parser with data_prep on hadoop
2. Integrate data_prep and data_pool
    a). I think that the data_prep should be a part of the data_pool, because all it does is preparing the data.
    b). I am seeing a lot of data_pool instances, they shouldn't all be necessary. For sequential run, there should
        only be two, one for training and one for testing.
    c). Why is the feature generator specified in the data_pool instead of the learner? Is it just me or is it
        really ridiculous?
    d). There should be a debug switch.
3. Restructure the learners
    a). There should be four learners now: 1) averaged perceptron; 2) perceptron; 3) averaged perceptron in parallel;
        4) perceptron in parallel. But currently 3) and 4) are squeezed into one file while part of 3) and 4) is in
        2).
    b). Functions of a specific class should make sense. Now, it's chaos.
    c). There should be a debug switch.
4. pos_tagger should be using data_pool as main data storage device.
5. pos_tagger should be using learners just like the parser.
6. After all is done, merge with Kingston.
